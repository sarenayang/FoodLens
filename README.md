# FoodLens  
**Main Goal:**  
FoodLens aims to reduce the uncertainty of choosing meals at restaurants by providing a clear visual representation of menu items. The app ensures that everyone can experience the joy of a good meal.  

**Description:**  
FoodLens uses Augmented Reality (AR) to showcase menu items visually. Restaurants and customers can upload scanned menu items to the app's shared database, allowing users to view dishes in AR before ordering.
